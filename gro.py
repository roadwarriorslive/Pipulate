Got a list that you need to look up something for every item - like grabbing
title tags for a list of URLs? Well, then GroPeY is your answer! For example,
for any given URL, you will be able to:

  1. Record the number of times that URL has appeared in a Tweet
  2. Record the number of times that URL was liked or shared in Facebook
  3. Record the number of times that URL was +1'd in Google Plus
  4. Figure out what keyword the page is trying to target for search traffic
  5. See how well that URL is doing for that keyword (position tracking)

And it all accumulates on a spreadsheet where you can do trending and keep
track of progress - all for free! But GroPeY is so much more, able to do such
lookups using any source data (addresses, keywords, etc.) against any Web or
data API source (you have access to), allowing you to write your own Python
functions to extend the system. And what system is that? You can learn it well,
because almost every line of code accompanied by a YouTube video. Playlist:
