Welcome to Pipulate, a free and open source SEO tool that outputs SEO
investigations like site crawls, position checks, and API-hitting lookup-jobs
directly into Google Docs. Also supports scheduling. You can try the tool on
http://pipulate.com, but it's designed to run directly on your own server
(starting with a 20MB download), but then can be moved off to the cloud,
Raspberry Pi or whatever.  The servers are tiny and disposable -- easily
instantiated, coming in at around 100 MB software footprint including OS,
programming language, webserver, application and all its dependences. This
little package is also designed to help you learn. Learn Linux. Learn Python.
Learn Flask. Learn vim. It works with a bookmarklet from your browser, popping
up a very minimal user interface when necessary, but generally sends the output
you want to keep... uh... into a spreadsheet.

Use Pipulate's "out of the box" capabilities, or expand it by writing
stand-alone Python functions, then just dropping them into your arsenal of
growing SEO and Social Media secret weapons that you may or may not share back
to the Github/SEO/Social Media communities. All your custom functions become
instantly accessible to you in Google Docs, alleviating the tedium of finding
your old scripts or wrangling custom home-built or expensive data-monitoring
systems. It all just natively works in Google Sheets&#151;effectively slapping
an Ironman suit onto aspiring SEO or Social Media professionals. Watch the
videos for inspiration on how you too may use it.

## 1\. Introduction
### Overview
Well, you pretty much got the overview in that opening paragraph, no? At any
rate, I connect a lot of unexpected dots here in this project, from Python, to
bookmarklets, to tiny servers, to leveraging massive Web API
infrastructure&#151;all in order to achieve great things. My main lesson is:
"Don't care about how much conventional wisdom dictates a thing, if you have
good reason to believe otherwise". My reasons? Oh, they amount to:

1. Master a minimal set of parts that let you achieve the most things.
2. Choose parts that are as disruption-proof as reasonably possible.
3. Do something interesting and useful that nobody's done before.
4. Design it so you'll actually want to use every single day.
5. Make it as approachable by newbs as possible.

### Project Background
I've been at this since 1994 with Microsoft idc/htx files, which is pretty much
when Web-accessible databases first became accessible to hackers like me that
haven't taken the plunge into Linux yet. The system has undergone many
iterations, becoming very Ruby-on-Rails-like long before ROR ever hit the
scene. But I'm not a compsci guy like David Heinemeier Hansson, and that's good
because when Google Spreadsheets came along, I saw 99% of the web apps I build
as becoming not necessary... except for how to sprinkle in the secret-sauce.

So, freed from the UI-designing world (right as it went into massive flux from
HTML5/CSS3/Browser Wars), I took the opportunity to (and had the pleasure of)
doing a complete re-write as my second major project on my new
Linux/Python/vim/git stack. All the fancy algorithm stuff that I used to plug
in on the back-end of a pre-ROR-like CRUD/MVC/blahblah app-builing framework
that I built. 

The extracted secret sauce became Pipulate&#151;the non-framework framework. It
sucks to have Google Spreadsheet as a dependency today, but as you use it, and
it worms its way into your day-to-day habits, you'll see the wisdom of this
approach, and why I await so anxiously a FOSS data layer with a built-in UI,
permissions, ecosystem, sharing and the like that Google Spreadsheets brings to
the picture.

### Python
Pouring secret sauce over a platter like Google Spreadsheets really only
requires sucking out the input-values and plugging back in the output-values.
I've done this about a zillion ways over the years, but the Python language has
this double-whammy advantage of being such a lovely language for beginners, and
having a variety of APIs already developed and available for interacting with
the majority of Google services. So, after much internal soul-wrenching debate
and experimenting to jury rigging the seemingly more appropriate JavaScript
language to this purpose, I yielded to Python and am so glad I did.

So today, Pipulate utilizes the extremely lightweight Python code execution
environment for everything, right down to the web hosting environment. There is
no Apache, nginx or node.js. Just the Python language. As such, you can use
Levinux-powered virtual servers on the desktop of your Mac, Windows or other
Linux machine to kickstart getting your own server, and later moving to the
cloud or a microserver like the Raspberry Pi. For the time being, you can use
http://pipulate.com.

### Bookmarklet
A web browser bookmarklet grabbed from the Pipulate user interface is how the
functions residing on Pipulate servers get invoked, and appear to infuse the
spreadsheet with magic data-collection powers&#151;enabling such tasks crawling
websites directly into a spreadsheet. The prevalent use of a bookmarklet in the
functioning of this app alone makes Pipulate a noteworthy project in Github,
but even more useful in actual day-to-day use. Imagining having to re-figure
everything out again each time you want to do some investigation of some site,
instead of just surfing to the site and clicking the bookmarklet. The
convention of using a bookmarklet to initiate investigations is a major
habit-forming boon that I suspect will contribute a lot to this project's
success and accumulation of followers. Combined with the data it collects being
instantly available, graph-able and share-able with your clients via Google
Spreadsheets... well, wow!  I think only [my YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/miklevin)
will be able to convey the awesomeness of these particular dots being
connected.

### Great for newbs!
Pipulate is an extendable system, plug-in compatible with Pipulate-unaware
standalone Python functions, making it wonderful for amateur coders looking to
extend a system. That's a long way of saying: just write a Python function
anywhere, anyhow you like (on your Mac or Windows desktop, for example), and
you can edit it into functions.py, and it'll magically become available from
the spreadsheet! Your function should take in input and return output for a
single value. In Pipulate (and thereby in Google Spreadsheets), your function
will be able to apply against a whole column of input values, sparing you the
need to code "for loops" and provide lists of input from text files and other
sources.

## 2\. Installation
Pipulate is made available ready-to-run on your desktop without an install.
Just download a copy of [Levinux](http://levinux.com), the Tiny Virtual Server
for Education, and select Option #4. It'll take awhile, but it'll build into a
Pipulate Server (minus scheduling, until you give it a gmail). I could
pre-build the server for you, but it's only one-time process, and I'd hate to
take away the opportunity for you to witness the process, perchance to poke
around and modify it yourself. And after you've had the Levinux experience, I
suggest you get it running on your own real hardware, from your main machine's
desktop to a Raspberry Pi.

### Runs On Anything
Get it running on your Mac, Windows or Linux desktop, from a ready-made virtual
machine, a cloud server, or even a Raspberry Pi or other teensy tiny computer.
It basically runs on anything. Then, visit the site you just created from a web
browser (usually at http://localhost:8888), drag the bookmarklet to your
Bookmark Bar, open a Google Spreadsheet, click the bookmarklet and get
Pipulating! The data-collecting job that the initial job defines just starts
twinkling in as new rows. You can get a taste of this from pipulate.com, where
you can use my demo instance to kick the tires. Here are the preferred
platforms for Pipulate in descending order of ease-of-installation and avoidance
of nuanced issues (like lxml on Windows under CygWin!):

### Debian/Ubuntu
From a Terminal:
- sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-lxml git
- sudo pip install requests
- sudo pip install flask_wtf
- sudo pip install gspread
- sudo pip install lxml
- pip install requests -U
- cd /var
- git clone https://github.com/miklevin/pipulate.git
- cd pipulate
- python webpipulate.py
- Visit http://localhost:8888

### Mac OS X
From a Terminal:
- (Python 2.7 & Distribute usually already installed)
- lxml? Must check if Macs have that by default.
- sudo easy_install pip
- sudo pip install requests
- sudo pip install flask_wtf
- sudo pip install gspread
- sudo pip install lxml
- cd ~/Desktop (or wherever)
- git clone https://github.com/miklevin/pipulate.git
- cd pipulate
- python webpipulate.py
- Visit http://localhost:8888

### Windows
- Install CygWin with the following selected:
  - python 2.7
   git
  - (lxml? Must check cygwin installer)
- Set Windows path to include Python (I will document better)
From a CygWin Shell (MinTTY):
- Download and run to get easy_install:
  - wget --no-check-certificate https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py
- easy_install pip
- pip install requests
- pip install flask_wtf
- pip install gspread
- pip install lxml

## 5\. Scheduling
But Pipulate isn't just for ad hoc investigations in spreadsheets. Once you're
happy with a particular data look-up task having worked out interactively, it
can be automated. Job instructions come from the Google Doc itself, turning
Pipulate servers into something as stateless and interchangeable as webheads.
No data resides on these servers. They are only there to Pipulate the Google
Spreadsheets. Get a Pipulate server from anywhere, fire-off a job, and then
destroy the server if you care to. Nothing's lost!

Scheduling is currently the only feature in Pipulate that needs configuration
values (username and password), but it is unwise to put your main username and
password in a file. Thankfully, Google provides this app specific way of
issuing passwords: https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords?pli=1

Once you're happy with the results of an ad hoc investigation (using question
marks), replace the question marks with asterisks, and invite in a special
gmail address that you set up, and watch the job get processed daily (or
whatever). More documentation coming on the use of the question marks and
asterisks to test, then schedule jobs coming soon. Also, look in the Config tab
to see the RowThrottleNumber setting that keeps more than this number of rows
from processing at once (great for SERP checking), and the RunJobEvery setting
that you can set to values like 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 days, 10 minutes, and
variations thereof.

## 6\. Customizing
Not happy with the built-in functions? Write your own, and contributing them
back to the project here on Github. Not comfortable with programming Python?
Copy and paste the examples under the Scrapers tab, experimenting with he XPath
and RegEx patterns to grab anything you like off a page. 

## 7\. FAQ
### OAuth2 For Your Security
Because this employs OAuth2 by default to avoid configuration files and storing
usernames and passwords, it will only work from localhost, or on machines
resolving from a registered domain. If you go the registered domain route,
you'll have to update the client_id under the getLoginlink to your own, under
Google's Developer Console: https://console.developers.google.com/project

### Username & Password For Scheduling
I don't have the web user interface built yet to query the admin for a GMail
username and password, and probably wouldn't be a good idea anyway, as I'm not
running the Web UI in https mode, to keep server configuration as simple as
possible. So that means to store a username and password on the computer (which
is not a good idea anyway) you must have a ../opt directory relative to
pipulate (a folder named opt next to pipualte) and run pipulate like this:

    python pipulate.py configure

This will prompt you for a username and password, and pickle it unencrypted
into ../opt. I recommend using a GMAil account that you set up specifically for
Pipualte, and then turn on 2-Step Verification and then use an App-specific
password, so that you can always revoke the password for that server. This is
all only an issue if you want scheduling. "Manual" pipulating works just fine
out of the box.

### Scheduling
I'm still working out the details of scheduling, specifically how to get the
scheduler to run as a background daemon the same way the Python webserver is.
There's nothing hard about it. Just haven't finished the work yet. To see it
roughly working, run pipulate like this:

    python pipulate.py scheduler

### Linux Auto-Start Daemon & Cron Job
Currently, the documentation on how to fully turn a Linux server into a
Pipulate server is contained in these files in the repository:

- pipulate
- pipuweb

The first file pipulate goes into /etc/init.d/ and then have the command:

    update-rc.d pipulate enable

...run once to set Pipulate to run in webserver mode, like Apache does, every
time the server is started up or reboots. The second file, pipuweb, gets
dropped into /etc/cron.hourly/ to ensure that the Pipulate webserver is always
running, even if some glitch made it stop. The way the daemon is written makes
it safe to keep trying to re-start the webserver. It won't create multiple
instances.

## 8\. Roadmap
